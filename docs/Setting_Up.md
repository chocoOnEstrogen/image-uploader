## Setting Up

To setup the application, you need to follow these steps:

- Edit the paths file.

### Edit the paths file

The paths file is located at your appdata directory. You need to edit the paths file to set the correct path for the application to serve the files.

For example, if I want to serve the files from the `C:\Users\user\Documents\files` directory, I need to edit the paths file to look like this:

```plaintext
C:\Users\user\Documents\files
```
